Column definitions in the data_qinf_*.dat files: P_transducer (psf) | T_transducer (degree F) | P_atmospheric (Pa) | I_sensor (mA)
Column definitions in the TF_vs_PerCentT.txt files: Turbulence Factor | Per cent turbulence

Notes:
- The data_qinf_*.dat files have all the data points collected for a given dynamic pressure setting.
- Calculate the density using ideal gas law.
- The report needs to be in the AIAA prescribed format.
- All results in your final report need to be in SI units.
- Focus on critial analysis. Point out and discuss interesting trends (if any) in the data.
