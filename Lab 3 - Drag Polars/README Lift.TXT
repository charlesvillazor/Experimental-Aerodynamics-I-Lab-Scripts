Column definitions in the alpha_*.dat files: Tap Number | Tap X-Coordinate (mm) | Tap Y-Coordinate (mm) | Dynamic Pressure (psf) | Tunnel Temperature (degree F) | Atmospheric Pressure (inches of Hg) | 10 Static Gauge Pressure Readings (psf)

Column definitions in the red-airfoil_coordinates.dat file: Normalized Airfoil X-Coordinate | Normalized Airfoil Y-Coordinate

Constants:
- airfoil chord = 0.3048 m
- dynamic viscosity of air = 1.825e-5 Ns
- density of mercury = 13,593 kg/m3 

Notes:
- The folder name corresponds to the Reynolds number at which the data was collected.
- The first 6 columns in the alpha_*.dat files are as defined above and the next 10 are the static gauge pressure readings collected for the given tap.
- For the lift analysis of the lab report, you are required to provide a plot similar to the one shown during the lab session for each Reynolds number. On the left plot, you will have the C_p distribution for all angles of attack. The right plot will have the C_l vs. alpha results from experimental data compared with XFOIL. 
- You will also need to plot the variation in C_l at each angle of attack.
- You should only have the average C_p distribution for a given angle of attack on the left plot. Do not plot 10 C_p distributions for each angle of attack.
- Co-plot the C_l vs. alpha data obtained at the different Reynolds numbers and discuss the variations in results.
- The report needs to be in the AIAA prescribed format.
- Focus on critial analysis. Point out and discuss interesting trends (if any) in the data.
